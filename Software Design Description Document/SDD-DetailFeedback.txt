==========================================

DETAILED CSC AND CSU DESCRIPTIONS:
   Well done on this section ~ nothing to add here.

DETAILED CLASS DESCRIPTIONS:
   Excellent and complete work on this section ~ nothing to add here.

DETAILED INTERFACE DESCRIPTIONS:
   Great job here as well, just think about for your next document, try to
   make sure that the headings stay on the same page as the text that goes
   with them.  There is a setting called "keep with next" that you can use
   to accomplish this.  Nothing to add here.

DETAILED DATA STRUCTURE DESCRIPTIONS:
   Good work on the details of the data structures ~ nothing to add here.

DETAILED DESIGN DIAGRAMS:
   The diagrams are pretty good.  The 'class' diagram is nice, although not
   strictly a class diagram.  The other two are a bit hard to read and don't
   really show much about the design since parts of them overlap each other.
   Still, good enough ~ nothing to add here.

DATABASE DESIGN AND DESCRIPTION:
   Awesome job on this section, too, and amazing work overall.  You four
   really took the project to heart and did an amazing job on the documents
   for the class.  You obviously take the concepts of software design and
   construction seriously and you will be great software engineers!

   Great job!
