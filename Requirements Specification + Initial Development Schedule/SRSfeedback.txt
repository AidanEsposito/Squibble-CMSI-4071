CMSI 4071 Fall 2024
=======================================

COMPONENT BREAKDOWN:
   This is a bit light, but you do list the different CSC's and what they
   are used for.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
   Excellent work here!  This is one of the most complete requirements sets
   I've seen this semester!  A couple of things to note:

   Whenever you see the word "and" in a 'shall' statement, you should see if
   that actually is two or three requirements, not just one.  For example:

      1.3.1.3 The page shall have a whiteboard that will have a fixed length
              and height and shall be navigable with dragging of the mouse,
              mousewheel, and arrow keys.

   This should be:

      1.3.1.3 The page shall have a whiteboard with a fixed length and height.
      1.3.1.4 The page shall be navigable by dragging the mouse.
      1.3.1.5 The page shall be navigable by scrolling the mousewheel.
      1.3.1.6 The page shall be navigable by using the arrow keys.

   Secondly, there should NOT be numbers on 'will' or 'should' statements.
   Those statements should come below a numbered 'shall' statement and will be
   associated with those numbered statements individually.

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:
   Your performance requirement statement is actually about the hardware, not
   the application as it should be.  If you don't have any requirements for
   your application's performance, you can simply say "Not Applicable."

ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS:
   Good job on this section!

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
   Category                          Points
   Component Breakdown                 1/1
   Functional Requirements             3/4
   Performance Requirements            2/2
   Environment Requirements            1/1
                                     =====
   Subtotal                            8/8
   Preliminary Schedule                2/2
   ------------------------------------------------------
   Total Percentage:   9/10 = 90% which is an A-minus

Take a stab at fixing some of those requirements and should statements, and
get it committed by the end of the semester for full credit on this document.

Excellent work, guys!
