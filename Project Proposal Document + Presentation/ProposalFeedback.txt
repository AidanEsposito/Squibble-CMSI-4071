Project Proposal Feedback
Project: squibble
=========================
Proposal Document [2 points]:
Nice work on this document!  The description section is well done and gives
a good idea of similar applications and what is different about yours.  The
integration of open source software is a great idea.  The justification
section, although short, covers what is needed.

Proposal Presentation [3 points]:
The presentation has some nice graphics, but is marred somewhat by the use
of Notepad to display the bullets.  If you had perhaps taken a picture or
snapshot somehow and clipped the menu and title bar out, it would have been
better, IMHO, although perhaps you did that on purpose to show the audience
the interactive nature of your application.

One further note, when I viewed the PDF in Adobe, the graphics were off the
bottom of the page, and on the title slide your names weren't centered.  It
may be that more testing is needed prior to committing to your repository.


Summary:
--------
Total:  5% out of 5% for this deliverable.

Nice job overall!  Keep up the good work.
